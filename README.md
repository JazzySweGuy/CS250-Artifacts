How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
* We accomplish this by interviewing and extracting information from potiential users adn then creating user stores to build a product to fit and match the information in the user stories. This in combination with following the project vision helps us create a product that useful to a customer base

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
* Going forward I'll approach coding with failure in mind and do my best to incorporate feedback to create the best possible projects. I hope to incorporate the diffrent information radiators to make progress and updates visable to anyone on the team who may need to see it or see how it relates beack to their work on the project. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development
* Being a good team memeber means communicating often and listening just as often. Being able to be humble enough to ask for help yet able enough to incorporate changes is what seperates a bad and good team member.
